        1.What This Privacy Policy Covers
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information we collect when you use or visit the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.
        <br><br>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including, but not limited to, any third-party websites, services, applications, or businesses (“Third-Party Services”). While we try to work only with those Third-Party Services that also respect your privacy, we are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-Party Services that you visit.
        <br><br>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to content that our users post on their profiles, and we are not responsible for the information collection and use practices of individual users. On {{ APPNAME }}, there is no built-in way to allow users to automatically collect data, and they must request it if they want any data from you.

        2.What information we collect and how we use it
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        (i) Account Information
        <br>
        When you create an account on the Services ("Account"), we ask you to provide information such as your username, password, age, email address, and phone number ("Account Information") in order to provide you with the Services. We may also use the Account Information alone or in combination with other information to enhance and improve the Services, such as through personalization. We use your age to verify that you can legally use the Services and to tailor content to your age. We use your email address to verify your account and to communicate with you. We allow users to find friends through their address book. However, you can opt out of phone lookup through your account settings.
        <br><br>
        (ii) Communicate with us via email
        <br>
        As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive emails and other communications from us. Administrative communications related to your account (such as for account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt out of receiving these communications. We may also send you other types of emails that you can opt out of from your Account Settings page.
        <br><br>
        (iii) Information about your accounts on third-party services
        <br>
        You may link your account to certain third-party services. To do so, you may choose to provide us with your username or other user ID for the third-party service, and you may then be required to log in to that service. Once you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on the Service so that we can post your content to the Service when you request it. We do not receive or store passwords for your accounts on third-party services.
        <br><br>
        (iv) User Content
        <br>
        By default, all information shared through the Service is public, with the exception of messages you receive or send (“Notifications”). In some cases, especially when the recipient decides to do so, Notifications may also be public. That is why you should always treat them as public, as well. Unless otherwise stated, you should assume that anything you post is public. Content that is posted and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, which may affect your control over that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Service. You should not be afraid to post content, but you should always remember that once posted, content is difficult to remove from the Internet.
        <br><br>
        (v) Native Actions
        <br>
        The Service allows you to perform actions that are essential to our products, such as liking a post, answering or commenting on {{ APPNAME }}, and following other users. The above actions are public by default, but you can choose to remain anonymous in some cases, such as if you follow someone. We use information about the operation of this machine to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, in particular, to personalize your {{ APPNAME }} experience. Personalization using this information may include showing you new posts related to content you like, providing you with better search results, and showing you ads that are more relevant to your interests.
        <br><br>
        (vi) Information About User Content
        <br>
        In some cases, we may collect information about the content you provide to the Services. For example, when content is included in your pictures, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings. This information enables us to improve the Services and provide additional features.
        <br><br>
        (vii) Location Information
        <br>
        In some cases, we collect and store information about your location, such as converting your IP address to a coarse geographic location. We may also ask you to provide information about your location, such as allowing posts to be geotagged using geolocation information from your mobile device. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, such as showing you relevant content and/or relevant ads.
        <br><br>
        (viii) Information About Your Mobile Device
        <br>
        We may collect and store information about your mobile device. In some cases, we may receive, generate, or assign a unique identifier to your mobile device for the purposes described above under “Information Related to Use of the Services.”

        3.Use of Personal Information
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        Anonymization is a data processing technique that removes or modifies personal information so that it cannot be associated with a specific individual. Except for this section, the other provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply to anonymous or aggregated personal data (i.e. user information that we combine together so that it can no longer identify or reference an individual user).
        <br><br>
        We may use anonymous or aggregated data for any business purpose, including to better understand users' needs and behaviors, to improve our products and services, to conduct business intelligence and marketing, and to detect security threats. We may perform our own analysis of anonymous data or enable analysis provided by third parties.

        4.Your Account and Content
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        If your content is publicly posted, it will remain public as long as you or we do not delete it from the Service. You can choose to delete your individual post or comment at any time, and we will remove it from the Service. However, it is important to note that your deleted posts may be stored in our systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, security, or system backup reasons, and they may continue to be accessible in cached and archived pages of the Service or elsewhere if others choose to copy or save them. Search engines and other websites may also index and cache content on our Service. You may have to contact these third-party websites or search engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and procedures.
        <br><br>
        If you wish to delete your account, you can do so by clicking the "Forget Me" button in the in-app settings. You can also delete your account using the "Email Support" link in the in-app settings (or by sending an email to {{ EMAILADDRESS }}), but please note that we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for the safety of {{ APPNAME }} (including its users) and others. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.

      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        We collect information about how people (including people who have accounts) use the Services. Each time you interact with (that is, make a request to) the Services, we may collect this information in our log files. We use internal tools and third-party applications and services to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol address ("IP address") used to access the Services; some may be associated with your account; and some may be collected and used only in aggregate form (as statistical metrics that do not identify you or your account). We also collect your IP address when you post, particularly when you submit a Tell. We may use information about how you and others interact with the Services for a variety of purposes generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including, but not limited to: delivering personalized content to users; delivering targeted advertising to users; improving our search results; identifying popular content; fighting spam, malware, and identity theft, and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for the legal and security reasons set forth in "Information Disclosures to Protect Us and Others."

        (ii) We have notified you in advance that the information will be shared and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy)
        <br>
        (iii) The information is aggregated or otherwise does not identify you.
        <br>

        We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from minors as defined by the laws of any applicable jurisdiction. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information from a minor, we will immediately delete that information. If you become aware of any minor using our Apps and Websites and Services, please notify us so that we can take action to block access to our Apps and Websites and Services.
